# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This app i will be contributing a small amount of time everyday for the next few months to make it a big website where we can do the following things:

1. Use the website as a travel journal and writing things that others wont be able to see
2. Make it like a social media app where people can shortlist the location and if they have visited the page can write about the experiences and different necessay things which can be used to learn by other users who are thinking or are going to that place.

These are the basic things that I have thought of and of course changes will be made as I will learn new things and learn to optimize it slowly and steadily.
